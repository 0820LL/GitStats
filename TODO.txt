- development statistics generator for git
	- should be as versatile as statcvs / statsvn
- XXX optimize author's first/last rev getting

[Information]
- git-log
- git-ls-files
	- Current list of files
- git-log --stat or --shortstat - N files changed, N insertions, N deletions
- git-log --name-status - svn-like list of modifications for each commit
- git-rev-list --all
	- first and last commit
- git-show-ref --tags
	- not all tags are tags on refs?
- git-log |git-shortlog -s
	- author: number of commits
- git-what-changed
- XXX git-log --pretty=oneline |wc -l != git-rev-list --all |wc -l
	- git-rev-list HEAD == git-log --pretty=oneline

	- Graph: Author Activity (bar for each author, showing modifying/adding percentages) (could be table)
	- Graphs: Activity by Clock Time
		- Hour of Day
		- Day of Week

- Commit logs
- Lines of Code (same as main graph)
