gitstats is a statistics generator for revision control systems (for now, only
git). It is mostly intended for developers, as a way to check some development
statistics for a project.

Requirements
============
- Complete git repository (bare or shallow will *not* do)
- Python
- Git (reasonably new version)

Recommended
===========
- Lot of memory and fast disk for large projects
