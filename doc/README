gitstats is a statistics generator for revision control systems (for now, only
git). It is mostly intended for developers, as a way to check some development
statistics for a project.

Requirements
============
- Python (>= 2.4.4)
- Git (>= 1.5.2.4)
- Gnuplot (>= 4.0.0)
- Complete, clean git repository (bare or shallow will *not* do)

The above versions are not absolute requirements; older versions may work also.

Recommended
===========
- Lot of memory and fast disk for large projects
