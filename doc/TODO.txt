- optimization: merge the two git-rev-list commands and use python instead of shell while loop
	- %at %an, remove %H & grep -v
- BUG linux-2.6 repository
	- git-log --pretty=format:"%at %an" |grep -C3 unknown
	- git-rev-list (for number of files in each revision) says "Warning: failed to parse line "<unknown> 17741"

[Unsorted]
- clean up after running gnuplot (option to keep .dat files around?)
- show raw data in some way (the tables used currently aren't very nice)
- allow multiple stylesheets
	- parameter --style
	- styles/{default,...}.css
- could show some statistics from last year, month, etc... pisg-like?
- use sortable.js
- Commandline options
	--title "Project name"
	--debug / --verbose
- state saving/restoring?
	- could save data that can not be recreated quickly (for example files/lines data)
